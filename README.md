# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
In this statistical analysis, we evaluate statistical results on a prototype car to provide a company with some useful insights on its performance. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG ##

Based on these results, we can extract some key insights from this data. First, the Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance provided the most non-random amount of variance in this dataset.  The slope of the model is not considered to be zero (as evidenced by Y-Intercept), and these results are highly significant (as evidenced by p-value). 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils ##

The design specifications for this prototype car require that the suspension coils not exceed 100 lbs per square inch. According to this manufacturing data, the prototype exceeds these requirements.
